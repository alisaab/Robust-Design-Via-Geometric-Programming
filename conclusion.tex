\section{Conclusion} \label{conc}
In this article we have described three different methodologies for creating approximate formulations of robust geometric programs. These methodologies build on each other to derive equivalent but increasingly less conservative formulations which are tractable as GPs, SPs, or conic optimization problems. Several aircraft design problems from the GP literature were robustified and a significant improvement over the state of art was shown, implying that robust programming may be a promising way to model uncertainties in engineering design. We are currently extending this work to solve Robust Signomial Programming problems.
