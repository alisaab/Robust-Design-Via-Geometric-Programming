An approximate formulation of a robust geometric program (RGP) as a convex program is proposed. Interest in using geometric programs (GPs) to model complex engineering systems has been growing, and this has motivated explicitly modeling the uncertainties fundamental to engineering design optimization. RGPs provide a framework for modelling and solving GPs while representing their uncertainties as belonging to an uncertainty set. The RGP methodologies presented here are based on reformulating the GP and then robustifying it with methods from robust linear programming. These new methodologies, along with previous ones from the literature, are used to robustify two aircraft design problems, and the results of these different methodologies are compared and discussed.
%This article proposes a new method to find a tractable formulation for robust geometric programming problems. This method is based on finding an equivalent representation of the geometric program where convex non-linear constraints would be deprived of any data. As a result, solving a robust geometric program needs just dealing with robust linear constraints that could be formulated as convex optimization problem in the case of conic uncertainty set, or parameters with log-normal distributions. Some special cases such as interval uncertainties and polyhedral uncertainties will lead to a geometric program again, in addition to elliptical uncertainties and log-normal uncertainties with certain monomial exponents.
